# 0.3.1
## Hotfix
- Hotfix because I am a silly goose and forgot to internally update the version of this mod.
- If you were playing with 0.3.0 previously and kept getting the notification upon starting the game that a newer version is available, this fix will make that go away.
- Absolutely no impact on gameplay otherwise; safe to apply to any campaign that already started with 0.3.0.
- Note that if for any reason you are running an older version of the patch to sustain an ongoing campaign, you will keep getting the notification.

# 0.3.0
## Legends 16.4.0+
** REQUIRES LEGENDS 16.4.0 AND ABOVE ONLY**
This is because of the newly reworked and reintroduced Unarmed perk tree.

### Unarmed Combat Rework/Reintroduction
Thanks to Legends Dev James Luong, the Unarmed perk tree has been reworked! PTR removed Unarmed in the past, but since this is an unofficial patch, I'm adding in the reworked Unarmed tree and you can decide for yourself if it fits in well with PTR.

The Unarmed tree will not spawn randomly. It is hard-coded to only and always appear for the following backgrounds:
- Berserker Commander
- Brawler
- Indebted
- Wildman
- Wildwoman
- Berserker from Adventuring Party Origin 
>Note: this was not in Legends 16.4.0; I think it was an oversight and have raised it with James and am yet to hear back from him. I'm making an executive decision for the Unofficial PTR Patch to include it anyway)

Basically the same as Legends.

# 0.2.0
## Legends 16.3.3+
- **REQUIRES LEGENDS 16.3.3 AND ABOVE ONLY**
    - If you are running any older version of Legends, do **not** use this version (and future versions) of this patch.
- Legends team have decided to remove the "dynamic perks" option and make it enabled by default from now on to improve maintainability.
- This change broke PTR which checks for that option.
- This fix will patch PTR code to no longer check for that option, which should make PTR playable with Legends 16.3.3
- Super duper big thanks to Legends dev James Luong for bringing this to my attention, and to Emo Used HM01 for pointing me to the message I missed!!!
- Note that the other feature changes in Legends 16.3.3, such as background perks, may still be overwritten by PTR 2.1.27 until I release another patch to port those changes over.

# 0.1.3
## Estoc 2H Revert
- Revert Estoc (and named Estoc) to 2H weapon
    - This means that characters who have the fencer perk (including enemies) will no longer get 3 AP Estoc Lunges

# 0.1.2
## Steel Brow Rework
- Legends reworked Steel Brow in 16.2.4 to convert Stun to Daze whenever a character with Steel Brow receives a Stun.
- This is an additional effect on top of PTR's Steel Brow changes (passive immunity to Cull).
- Updated the perk and effect descriptions/tooltips to reflect this.
- Note that as of Legends 16.2.4, the new Steel Brow effect mini icon above the character's head in battle is still using a placeholder Lone Wolf mini icon (same for the new Lurker effect for Assassins).

# 0.1.1
Fixed a small little bug that CAUSED THIS ENTIRE PATCH TO NOT WORK.

Special thanks to Seafood for reporting the bug on the Discord.

# 0.1.0
This unofficial patch aims to bring PTR (2.1.27) up-to-date with the latest Legends (16.2.3 Smoke and Faith).

For this first pre-release build, I will focus on the changes to the Assassin.

## Adjustments to Perks
Various perks require adjustments in PTR following the changes in Legends.

### Throwing Mastery Perk
- Add handling for new Assassin Knifeplay skill
    - PTR overwrites the Legends `perk_mastery_throwing.onAnySkillUsed()` function. To accommodate this new skill I have updated PTR's implementation to enable its effects on Knifeplay.

### Whites of their Eyes Perk
- Add handling for Whites of their Eyes (PTR version of Close Combat Archer)
    - In a similar fashion to the Throwing Mastery Perk, I have made adjustments to enable its effects on Knifeplay.

### Camouflage Perk
- Legends has retired this perk as it does not work correctly. I have likewise removed it from PTR
- Affected Perk Groups:
    - Devious Trait Perk Group
    - Legend Assassin Background
    - Legend Assassin Commander Background
    - Legend Druid Background
    - Legend Druid Commander Background
    - Legend Ranger Background
    - Legend Ranger Commander Background

## Updating the PTR Assassin Profession Perk Tree
Legends reworked the `AssassinMagicTree` which is common to all Assassin backgrounds. PTR does not use this tree but has its own similar `AssassinProfessionTree`.
I have opted to merge the two trees into an updated `AssassinProfessionTree`

__How to read the table:__
- __Tier__ column is the Tier at which the perk is available in the tree
- __Legends__ column is for the perks from the newly reworked `AssassinMagicTree`
- __PTR__ column is for the perks from the current PTR `AssassinProfessionTree`
- __Result__ column is for the perks in my updated version of PTR's `AssassinProfessionTree`
| Tier | Legends: `AssassinMagicTree` | PTR: `AssassinProfessionTree` | Result: `AssassinProfessionTree` | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | --- | ------ | ----- |
| T1 | Knifeplay | Prisoners Rush | Knifeplay | *(Knifeplay is much more interesting than Prisoners Rush. By removing Prisoners Rush however, this also means that PTR no longer uses it. On the other hand Legends still has it in some Trees)*|
| T2 | Opportunist || Opportunist ||
| T3 | Prepared | Knife Fighting | Prepared | *(Same reasoning as Prisoners Rush)*|
| T4 | | Rotation | Rotation ||
| T5 | Lurker | Twirl | Lurker, Twirl | *(Mobility seems to be an important kit in PTR's interpretation of the Assassin, so I will keep Rotation and Twirl for now, even if this may make the Assassin profession a bit OP with the new perks added)*|
| T6 | Night Raider | Camouflage | Night Raider | *(Camouflage has been retired)* |
| T7 | Assassinate | Assassinate | Assassinate ||


## Assassin Origin Static Perk Tree Patch
Both PTR and Legends make has a static perk tree for the Assassin Commander, which is the Player Avatar for the Assassin Origin.
In this section I will go over how the PTR and Legends versions have been different, and how I will patch the PTR version to bring it in line with the SaF changes.

Note that this only patches `legend_assassin_commander_background`, which means it only affects the player avatar for the Assassin Origin.
This will *not* affect the other Assassin backgrounds, which means any other Assassins recruited will not have these specific changes.
### PTR Perk Groups Assignment
- Keep PTR-assigned Perk Groups as of PTR 2.1.27:
    - DaggerTree
    - SwordTree
    - LightArmorTree
    - ViciousTree
    - UnstoppableTree
    - DeviousTree
    - TrapperClassTree
    - MaceTree
- Added the revamped Assassin Perk Tree introduced in Smoke And Faith (Legends 16.2.3):
    - AssassinMagicTree *(T1: Knifeplay, T2: Opportunist, T3: Prepared, T5: Lurker, T6: Night Raider, T7: Assassinate)*

### Static Perk Tree
__How to read the tables:__ 
- __Legends__ column is Legend's static perks for that tier
- __PTR__ column is PTR's static perks for that tier
- __Result__ column is the result of this Patch (what is hardcoded into the Static Perk Tree)
- Note that these tables do not include perks added by the PTR Perk Groups assigned earlier
    - PTR hardcoded some perks into the static tree even though some of they might already be in the earlier PTR-assigned Perk Groups; that is why they are in the following tables.
    - This table is a reference for how the Static Perk Tree was updated
    - The actual Perks the Assassin Commander will spawn with will be presented in a later table
